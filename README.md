# Machine Learning Project 1

This repository contains the mandatory assignment for the Machine Learning course (Spring 2025) by Kasper Søballe Poulsen.

The assignment consists of several small projects using different machine learning techniques, including classification, dimensionality reduction, and clustering. Both real-world and synthetic datasets were used.

## 📁 Contents

### 🔹 Exercise 1
**Classification of synthetic datasets using neural networks and SVMs**
- `moons_dataset_nn.py`: Tested different hidden layers and alpha values on the `make_moons` dataset using a neural network.
- `circles_snippet.py`: Classified the `make_circles` dataset using SVMs with different kernel functions (rbf, poly, linear, sigmoid).

### 🔹 Exercise 2
**Titanic survival prediction**
- `Titanic.py`: Cleaned and preprocessed the Titanic dataset, handled missing values, and converted categorical data.
- Compared two models: **Neural Network** and **Random Forest**.
- Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

### 🔹 Exercise 3
**Dimensionality reduction and clustering**
- `iris.py`: Applied PCA to reduce dimensions of the Iris dataset and visualized clusters using KMeans.
- `faces_pca_svm.py`: Used PCA and SVM to classify faces in the Olivetti Faces dataset. Tested different hyperparameters and discussed potential improvements.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision / Recall
- Confusion Matrix
- Visual plots of classification and clustering results

## 📌 Notes

This project was completed as part of a school assignment during the Machine Learning course. It was an individual, mandatory task and not a final exam.
